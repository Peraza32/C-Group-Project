# C-Group-Project

A little repository for group projects, currently developed in C++

There are three branches:
  * **master**: Parts of the project that are bugs free (or almost), and have been approved in consensus by all the members of the poject
  * **Temporary**: All new commits are stored here, in order to not override the main banch with some buggy or conflicting version
	* **Testing**: Versions are stored here before passing to master, in order to be tested by all members of the project (or the designated tester in case of being one), 
									so it could be determine if it's ready to be incorporate into the main branch or return to temporary in case it's has failed the test in some way.
									
Possible branch additions: deploy, refactor, It's truly necessary?, don't know how it works but does it.
